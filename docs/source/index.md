This library provides a simple visual countdown widget
[Textual](https://textual.textualize.io) applications, designed to subtly
let the user know that a period of time is passing; essentially a simple
"wait some time" progress bar.

Example uses for the widget could be as a non-intrusive countdown in some
sort of quiz application, or a cool-down display in an application that's
waiting to hit a busy API endpoint again.
